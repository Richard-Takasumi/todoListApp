# TodoListApp
<p>
  This is a full stack (MERN) todo application with drag and drop functionality.
</p>

# Note!
<p>
  The first load will take ~15 seconds! This is because the backend is hosted for free. So after 15 minutes of inactivity, the backend server will wind down.
</p>

# How to install packages:
Install packages in server and client directories respectively.
<p>
  <li>cd server --> npm install <br/>
  <li>cd client --> npm install
</p>

# How to run:
<p>
  Inside the root (not server or client) <br/>
  <li>npm run dev
  <li>enjoy!
